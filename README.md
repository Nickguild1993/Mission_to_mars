# Mission to Mars 

I just want to start this ReadME off by going over the issues I've had to deal with to complete this challenge. I know that my webpage isn't perfect but I have spent hours upon hours both by myself, in my tutoring time, and in office hours trying to get the webpage we were scraping the hemispheres from to work.  I was locked out of the webpage twice which meant I was unable to access it.  Everytime I'd try to run the ```scrape new data``` button and the function it calls, it would take at least 10 tries before it returned a successful scrape (the failed attempts were server disconnects because the webpage would fail to load).   Getting this to work at leats 90% of how it's supposed to has been the single most frustrating experience I've had in the course.  I apologize that it's not perfect, and believe me, I have *tried so hard* to make it as good as I can get it given the obstacles I have had to deal with.  

Please refer to the (4) images i uploaded for proof that the website does indeed scrape the the hemisphere images and loads them on the webpage with their respective titles (although the best I could ever get was 3 to laod- the first image in the set displayed the ```alt_tag``` I put in my HTML because it wouldn't load).  There is also the image of my webpage showing a successful scrape, and the last image is of the top of my webpage in case for whatever reason, that doens't load.  

Again, I'm sorry it's not perfect, but I am at my wits end trying to work with a webpage that won't load properly, no matter what I do.
